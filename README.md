# Jim-Consumables

## FiveM MultiFrameork Consumables script

# What is this?
This script WAS designed as a replacement/override for food and drink consumables in `qb-smallresources`

It's main purpose was to make it so players did not stand up while sitting with my scripts due to lazy events such as ClearPedTasks in progressbar and dpemotes, this one is designed to cancel the animation you have chosen, not ALL animations.

Users requested I readd the progressbar but it ended up being a config option to enable it

Though if your players are cancelling all animations when consuming, it's recommended to set `Config.UseProgBar` to `false` to get this effect.

# THIS DOESN'T USE DPEMOTES OR RPEMOTES OR SCULLYS EMOTEMENU
